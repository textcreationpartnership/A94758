            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ventured forth a tender piece, which is not likely to eſcape the cenſure of ſuch as are guilty, whom perhaps it may make to <hi>ſmart;</hi> and therefore it will need the <hi>patronage</hi> of ſuch as are <hi>very diſcerning,</hi> and <hi>very ſincere.</hi> Such I eſteem you, and from my very ſoule doe bleſſe God for you, and have hopes that God hath in it his thoughts to refreſh this poore and torne nation, and the Churches, becauſe he hath given <hi>courage</hi> to ſo many able and godly <hi>Divines</hi> to meet together, though <hi>threatned</hi> with <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> to the contrary, and being met, a <hi>ſweet agreement</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles and the love of the truth, though <hi>prophecied</hi> of by ungodly, wanton and prophane witts, that they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently breake aſunder through variety of opinions. Truely if you had brought with you that <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>pomp</hi> which we were wont to ſee in our former <hi>mock-Synods</hi> and <hi>Convocations,</hi> we might have expected that before this time you ſhould have been the <hi>diriſion</hi> and <hi>ſcorne</hi> of the <hi>Prelaticall</hi> and <hi>Atheisticall
<pb facs="tcp:155614:3"/>party.</hi> But for ever bleſſed be the name of God, for that <hi>ſweet condeſcenſion,</hi> for that <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>reſolved ſubjection</hi> unto <hi>light,</hi> for that <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>holy purſuit</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> which all-together doe promiſe an happy iſſue of your meeting. Goe on with your <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>holy debates,</hi> and the Lord ſo bleſſe them and crown them, that your <hi>advice</hi> being lay'd before our great and high <hi>Court,</hi> they may under God ſettle upon us the glory of all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and remove every <hi>burthen</hi> which the <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> of <hi>abuſed Epiſcopacie</hi> had layd upon us. I call their courſes <hi>tyranny,</hi> and their Impoſitions <hi>burthens,</hi> as having had thorough the happineſſe of theſe late times, better meanes and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to <hi>diſcerne</hi> and <hi>weigh</hi> them: for let me ſpeake <hi>freely,</hi> and as becomes us now that the hand of God is ſo much out againſt the nation, let me ſpeake <hi>humbly,</hi> I confeſſe my <hi>thoughts</hi> were heretofore more <hi>favourable,</hi> as walking according to thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples I had received in my education. The truth is, though I never thought <hi>Epiſcopacie</hi> to be of <hi>Divine-right,</hi> as it was <hi>proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> chalenged, yet I looked upon it as the moſt <hi>antient</hi> and moſt <hi>prudentiall way of government,</hi> and ſo obeyed it and ſpake well of it, though not its mad and furious wayes, for I ever proteſted againſt their <hi>Altars</hi> and their <hi>cringes,</hi> their ſuppreſſing of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and painfull <hi>Preachers,</hi> their <hi>diſcouraging</hi> and <hi>undermining</hi> of the <hi>power of godlineſſe,</hi> their wanton and profane abuſe of the high and dreadfull cenſure of <hi>excommunication;</hi> yet in a generall conformity to ſuch things as I conceived were by law eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, I obeyed it, as thinking it to be a ſin not to have done ſo. I will not be aſhamed to put thoſe <hi>charitable thoughts</hi> I had (for ſo I will call them, and ſo my own conſcience after I examined it, doth call them) among the <hi>errata</hi> of my life. The reading of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> firſt made me ſtumble in the point of <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> but afterwards when I met with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Whites learned</hi> and <hi>ſerious Speech</hi> againſt it in <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was afterwards <hi>printed,</hi> to the great good I believe of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as no doubt inviting many to look into that point, which they had not formerly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
<pb facs="tcp:155614:3"/>I was fully convinced of the <hi>inconveniencies</hi> and <hi>miſchiefes</hi> of it among us.</p>
            <p>It may be the <hi>wiſedom of this generation,</hi> will account it an <hi>unwary</hi> and <hi>imprudent</hi> part in me, to expreſſe my ſelf ſo <hi>freely</hi> and ſo <hi>nakedly,</hi> in a time when all the religious endeavours of our <hi>Parliament</hi> run ſuch a dangerous hazard, and when the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Popiſh Counſels</hi> drive on with ſuch advantage; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that in ſuch a <hi>throng</hi> of <hi>accidents</hi> and <hi>occurrances,</hi> wherein a man may eaſily <hi>loſe</hi> himſelfe and <hi>miſſe</hi> the <hi>times</hi> he would faine <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>comply</hi> with, it were better to <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> till the <hi>times</hi> found and came up to him: but give me leave to breath out a <hi>ſad thought</hi> or two, I much doubt we ſhall not meet thoſe <hi>good times</hi> we look for, for as ſome <hi>Declarations</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Books</hi> formerly and of late, have made it manifeſt, that there is a <hi>deſigne</hi> for the <hi>readvancement</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> ſo I feare the <hi>counſells</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are that way for our <hi>tryall,</hi> I meane the <hi>word of prophecie</hi> in the eleventh chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> concerning which thing I profeſſe I have not ſeen M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mead's</hi> argument ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, That <hi>that ſlaying is yet to be expected.</hi> I ſhould with all my heart ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the contrary opinion, and ſhould be glad to be found in an <hi>error</hi> in this thing, and I hope I am in one. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, this opinion is ſo far from <hi>weakening</hi> and <hi>diſengaging</hi> of me, that it carries me on more <hi>effectually</hi> and <hi>reſolvedly</hi> in the good liking of all the preſent <hi>attempts</hi> for <hi>Reformation;</hi> for by comparing the <hi>Prophecie,</hi> with the late and preſent <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the <hi>Kings-Army,</hi> and of ſome <hi>Princes abroad,</hi> I have collected that whoſoever runs all along to the end of the <hi>courſe</hi> with the <hi>Court-Counſels</hi> and <hi>Armie,</hi> muſt be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> at laſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be now, or whatſoever his thoughts be yet.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe conſiderations, I had once reſolved to have brought my Hypocrite before the <hi>Parliament-barre,</hi> and in an humble <hi>Dedication,</hi> to have <hi>Indicted</hi> it before them, the <hi>grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate-Hypocriſie,</hi> I had drawn up ſome <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Impeachment</hi> to that purpoſe, but this very weeke, while I was thinking of it,

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were the <hi>ordinary Doctors or Teachers of the Church,</hi> ſuch as had the gift of <hi>Prophecie,</hi> that is of interpreting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For we may collect it from <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15. Where we reade, that <hi>after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the Rulers of the Synagogue, ſent</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who were then preſent, ſaying, <hi>Men and Brethren, if yee have any word of exhortation for the people, ſay on;</hi> That the uſe was, that ſome place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being read, then one of the Doctors aroſe, and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, and drew ſome Doctrines or Exhortations from it, and after him another, and ſo a third, or if there were more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb facs="tcp:155614:5"/>or teachers there, they ſpake in courſe. Or whether they were an <hi>office diſtinct</hi> from the office of ordinary teachers, namely ſuch who opened the more hidden points, pertaining to Chriſtian Religion; as is intimated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. where <hi>Prophets</hi> and teachers are diſtinguiſhed. But whatſoever thoſe Prophets were, this is it only that I enquire upon the place, what judging it is that is there ſpoken of, and what ſubjection of ſpirit. For though the <hi>learned Camera</hi> be abſolute in it, that the Apoſtle deales not there <hi>de probatione ſeu diſcretione ſpirituum,</hi> but only ſpeaks of <hi>order,</hi> that the <hi>Prophets</hi> aſſembled had authoritie (when it may be two or three might riſe together) to appoint who ſhould ſpeake, and in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the reſt to be ſilent. And though I grant this may be the <hi>ſpeciall intent</hi> of the place, becauſe of the Argument that follows, <hi>Ver.</hi> 33. <hi>For God is not the Authour of confuſion</hi> (or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult) <hi>but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints</hi> (i.) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is the uſe and cuſtome of the reſt of the <hi>Churches,</hi> with which the Apoſtle would have that of <hi>Corinth</hi> (wherein haply were nouriſhed ſome proud and forward wits) to agree. Yet, may not this alſo be comprehended, that the Prophets might and were to judge of the ſpirits of thoſe Prophets, who would be forward to riſe and offer to ſpeake: Some it may be out of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>stomacke;</hi> ſome out of <hi>Envie,</hi> leaſt ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould be delivered of a choice notion before them; ſome it may be pretending ſpeciall revelation and commiſſion to ſpeake. I doubt not, but even yet, <hi>a privater meeting of Divines</hi> in a <hi>Claſſis</hi> or <hi>Prophecying</hi> (as they ſay they were wont to call the <hi>Monethly Exerciſes</hi> in <hi>Cheſhiere</hi> and thoſe parts, heretofore) but much more ſuch a <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>venerable Aſsemblie</hi> as yours, may judge not only of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that is ſpoken, but of the ſpirit of him that ſpeakes.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have undertaken the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi>

For as the Church in all ages hath been ever full of unſound members, a <hi>Cain</hi> living in externall communion with <hi>Abel,</hi> an <hi>Iſhmael</hi> with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a <hi>Judas</hi> with the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> with the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> bran with the meale, bad fiſh in the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, tares in the wheat-field: So eſpecially in the time of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches credit, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is made a <hi>praiſe</hi> in the Earth, many that were ſtrange unto her, and that were wont to looke upon her, as if they had not knowne her, will then be of her acquaintance, and claime friendſhip, that they may partake of her <hi>Reputation.</hi> The <hi>Samaritan</hi> will be of neare kindred to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> when they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155614:9"/>are in proſperity; and when the feare of the <hi>Jewes</hi> is upon the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> many of the Nations will joyne themſelves unto them.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be God that we live to ſee <hi>Religion</hi> beginning to recover her <hi>lovelineſſe,</hi> and that men confeſſe ſhe is <hi>beautifull;</hi> but we will not believe, that all who now <hi>wooe</hi> and <hi>court</hi> her, are <hi>in love</hi> with her; for ſeeing they were aſhamed of her <hi>raggs,</hi> we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are now taken with her <hi>Dowry,</hi> not with her <hi>face;</hi> and pretend love, becauſe the preſent <hi>State</hi> doth <hi>countenance</hi> and bid ſo faire a <hi>Portion</hi> with her.</p>
                  <p>We muſt needs ſay, that the time hath been, that ſome hard and drie froſts have locked up the Earth, that little fruit hath ſprung up, and thoſe fruits of holineſſe which did ſpring were too much nipt and blaſted. We have felt of late ſome warme and comfortable <hi>ſhowers,</hi> a feeding and refreſhing <hi>raine:</hi> but as that weather is good for the <hi>Corne,</hi> ſo it brings up likewiſe abundance of <hi>Weeds. Hypocrites</hi> come up thicke and grow faſt in ſuch ſeaſons. As this point therefore is alwaies uſefull, ſo eſpecially now in ſuch a time as this moſt ſeaſonable and neceſſary, that we may have ſome helpe in ſome meaſure to underſtand other men; and may be able every one to diſcerne our owne hearts, that we deceive not our ſelves, which is indeed the principall thing that I aime at,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.5. 1 Cor. 13.7. Rom. 14 4.</note> and which the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> conſtantly commend unto us, <hi>To prove</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> our ſelves; not to be apt to <hi>ſuſpect,</hi> to <hi>condemne</hi> others.</p>
                  <p>And here let me take occaſion once for all,
<note place="margin">A prevention of miſtake.</note> before I enter upon the worke, to put in a <hi>caveat</hi> againſt the <hi>prejudices,</hi> to which ſuch a Diſcourſe as this may be ſubject, and againſt the ill uſe which worldly and carnall men may put it unto. I know that all ſpeech of and againſt Hypocriſie is acceptable to prophane men, who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne the edge of every Tryall and Reproofe this way, upon the breaſts of all that are (as they are called for diſtinction) <hi>Profeſſours,</hi> and doe account every <hi>Profeſſour</hi> to be an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and doe hate the godly under this pretence,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.63. 2 Cor. 6.8.</note> that they are Hypocrites. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was called a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> and ſo they reckoned the Apoſtles. So that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Godlineſſe come to be hated under other names and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. But let ſuch men know, that they ſhall ſtumble at my very threſhold, if they faſten any ſuch intentions upon my preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, or upon my thoughts, which are full of honour toward all them that feare God, and walke before him in an holy, open and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155614:9"/>publike Profeſſion of his name, which is ſo neceſſary, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily there is no ſalvation without it; according to that of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, with the heart man beleeveth unto righteouſneſſe,
<note place="margin">Rom 10.10. <hi>Vid</hi> Abra. <hi>Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet.

                     <note place="margin">Mark. 8.58. Luk. 9.26.18.8. 2 Tim. 2.12. Iſa. 44.5.</note> of them will <hi>Christ</hi> be aſhamed before his Father. Shall that then be generally cenſured for Hypocriſie, which God requires of us, as a neceſſary duty? If any man therefore ſhall ſay, <hi>He is the Lords, and call himſelfe by the name of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and ſurname himſelfe by the name of</hi> Iſrael: Be tender of ſuch a mans reputation, and be not ready to entertaine a charge againſt him raſhly, but reſpect him for his <hi>cloth</hi> ſake, and the <hi>liverie</hi> that he weares. Oh diſgrace not theſe ſervants of God, for <hi>God</hi> who is their <hi>Maſter</hi> will revenge their diſgrace;
<note place="margin">Jude ver. 15.</note> yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> will account all your <hi>hard ſpeeches</hi> to have bin ſpoken againſt himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>We ſee how dangerous it may prove to judge others, but againſt our ſelves we may be ſafely ſevere, and unleſſe in ſome ſpeciall caſes of <hi>Deſertion</hi> and <hi>Despaire,</hi> we may apply all rules of <hi>Diſcoverie</hi> and cenſure to our ſelves thoroughly, without hazard. And this I profeſſe to be my main Scope, to put a candle into every mans hand, when he is alone by himſelf in a dark roome.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Such as know not themſelves to be Hypocrites, but think themſelves in a good eſtate and ſound enough.

                  </p>
                  <p>Whether the firſt kind may be properly called ſo, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; but 'tis of the ſecond ſort I am to treate. And under this the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> take notice of three ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as pretend and ſeeme to have holineſſe and virtue,
<note place="margin">Undipt.</note> which they have not.

                  <p n="2">2. Such as pretend vertue,
<note place="margin">Dipt.</note> and yet will and live in the contrary vice. As if a man live in the act of wantonneſſe, in his luſts, and yet will ſeem and have the reputation of being continent and chaſt. This is <hi>Dipt-hypocriſie,</hi> hypocriſie of the firſt die, the firſt ſtaine.</p>

                  <p>THE way that I have hitherto gone, hath been dry and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unpleaſant, and I have run over it with more ſpeed. But here I have found a Spring, here I will ſit down and pitch, here I ſhall ſtay long: and I hope the Reader will be content to linger here. 'Tis a fruitfull plot, every one may gather ſomething; and ſomething haply he ſhall meet with that will meet with him. I will leade him up and down to view this <hi>vale</hi> of <hi>wonders,</hi> and now and then bring him to a Chriſtall fount, wherein he may look down and ſee his own face. And if he will venture and take paines, and follow; I will guide him into the darke and narrow cavern's of mens hearts. But he muſt take paines, and ſometimes ſtoop, and carry a candle lighted at the holy Scripture in either hand. For mens wayes are darke and ſtreight, like ſome caves that reach farre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the earth, under the hanging of ſome mountain or ſteep rock.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:155614:13"/>
                  <p>'Tis an hard work I ſet upon, for as it is in the Prophet; <hi>Men ſeek deep to hide their counſell from the Lord,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 29.15.</note> and their works are in the dark.</hi> We ſhall have much adoe to follow and find theſe men, becauſe they have learned of <hi>Adam,</hi> to run and hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the thickets.
<note place="margin">Gen. 3. Rev 9.8.</note> They have Lyons teeth, and yet weare wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens hayre, and who would think ſuch deceit were under ſuch faire locks? They are Wolves, and yet weare Sheepes-cloathing, Who would not be beguiled with ſuch garments? The Painter in <hi>Plinie</hi> made a Bird ſo lively, that true live Birds were deceived with it; The Horſe in <hi>Aelian,</hi> neighed at the picture of an Horſe. But theſe men have more skill to beguile even men, Chriſtians, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men; they can paint the Chriſtian ſo well, and ſet it with ſuch lively colours. How neatly did <hi>Judas</hi> carry it, when the Apoſtles were ready to ſuſpect every one themſelves, rather then him? They ſaid, <hi>Maſter, is it I? is it I?</hi> but none of them ſaid, Maſter is it <hi>Judas?</hi> It cannot be an eaſie ſearch, becauſe the hypocrite leaves not a track, but oft times finds an untrodden way. Their way is <hi>as the way of a ſhip in the ſea.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 30.19.</note> An horſe-way is known by the track, and where a Cart hath gone, we perceive by the print of the wheeles; but we know not the way of a ſhip: Though <hi>Mercator,</hi> and <hi>Hondius,</hi> and <hi>Jonſton,</hi> or others of them in their <hi>Mapps,</hi> draw lines of <hi>Drakes</hi> and <hi>Schoutens,</hi> or other mens voyages, yet the Marriner can ſee no ſuch path upon the ſea: So is the way of the Hypocrite. Or if we have ſome directions and markes to follow them, yet we may miſſe of them at the very laſt. They are as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to keep ſecret their ſinnes, as an harlot doth her lover. The Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Emperour <hi>Henry the third,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>incent. Spec Hiſt.</hi> l. 25. c. 10.</note> when a great ſnow fell, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her lover upon her ſhoulders, that the fact might not be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: The lover is entertained, but nothing can be ſeen but the print of the Ladies feet. The Hypocrite harbours his luſt, but ye ſhall find nothing but the footſteps of the upright. A cunning thiefe hides himſelfe not more cloſely in a diſ-orderly blind ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; Nor doth a zealous-ſhee-papiſt hide her Prieſt with more ſecrecie and care, then ſin is hid by the Hypocrite; You may ſearch all roomes and miſſe, he hath a ſecret vault and a falſe dore. And finally, it is harder to diſcover hypocriſie then the tricks of an horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſer in a faire.</p>
                  <p>Yet as hard as it is, we muſt upon our journey. The <hi>Signes,</hi> or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:155614:13"/>as I chuſe rather to call them, the Symptom's of Hypocriſie, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are diſeaſes alſo themſelves incident to the grand diſeaſe of Hypocriſie, and which ſerve to diſcover it,) are many and far more perhaps then I can take notice of; I want the benefit of long experience and great practiſe, having lived moſt out of the croud; but yet many I have obſerved, and will diſpoſe them under theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing heads.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. 1. <hi>Two Symptomes from the principle of the working of Hypocrites. They worke not in Gods ſtrength. Not to or for God. Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath an externall and artificiall Cauſe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere are two things that I take notice of under this head.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fruits which hypocrites bring forth,
<note place="margin">Hypocrites work not in Gods ſtrength</note> they bring them not forth in Chriſt, in the ſtrength of his power, or in reference to his Law, the command of his mouth. There are branches which bring fruit, but yet not in the vine. The ſap of the vine-ſtock comes not to theſe branches to put forth in them. Thus that of our Saviour, which our laſt <hi>Tranſlation</hi> renders,
<note place="margin">Joh. 15.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit:</hi> We may reade without wrong to the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,</hi> and with very good authority, <hi>Every branch that in me beareth not fruit.</hi> This ſenſe the <hi>Syriac</hi> follows, and the <hi>Arabick</hi> of the <hi>Roman Edition,</hi> obſerved by <hi>Erpenius. Tremellius</hi> thus tranſlates it, and ſo doe our old <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Geneva.</hi> And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:155614:14"/>this reading ſeem's beſt to ſatisfie the place, for Hypocrites are branches, but not in Chriſt. Now Chriſt in that place ſeems to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between hypocrites, whom he calls <hi>branches</hi> only, or branches, that though they doe beare ſome fruit, yet beare it not in him; and his true and ſound members whom he calleth <hi>branches bearing fruit.</hi> This appeares to be his meaning, becauſe the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is not <hi>in him,</hi> as it is further cleare from the ſixth verſe, where this phraſe receives more light, <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch.</hi> And in the fifth verſe it is ſaid, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in (Chriſt) and <hi>abideth in him, he brings forth much fruit.</hi> The hypocrite then may bring forth fruit too, ſuch as it is, but not <hi>in Chriſt.</hi>

Hypocrites have an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe of working. <hi>Th. Herbert</hi> Deſcrip. of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mon. p. 8.</note> They may bring forth fruit, as it was ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet be <hi>empty vines.</hi> Iſrael <hi>is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit unto himſelf.</hi> Empty of ſap from Chriſt, though full of other principles, a vine whoſe fruit is but leaves, as the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint</hi> reades it, a dry withered vine, as it is in the <hi>Chalde para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe,</hi> though full of ſome ſap, ſuch as it is; as we ſay a wine veſſell is an empty caske, when there is no wine in it, though it be full of ſomewhat elſe, full of ayre. An Hypocrite may bring forth fruits of Temperance and Juſtice, but ſo as <hi>Socrates</hi> was temperate, and <hi>Aristides</hi> juſt; full of their own ſtrength, not ſenſible of the need of Chriſt, not in reference unto Chriſt, not in the faith and ſtrength of him. They doe not ſpeake it ſo plainely, with <hi>Cicero,</hi> That virtue is ſufficient to help it ſelfe, and with <hi>Seneca,</hi> that we need not trouble God; but if we could dig under the rootes of theſe vines, we ſhould find ſomewhat like to that morall ſpirit and principle in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many hypocrites have their gales of devotion, and are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſtrong in it ſo long as the wind ſits that way, but when the fitt is over and the humour downe, then they faile, and loſe it, and run another courſe; like thoſe winds that ſome Travellers ſpeake of, about <hi>Sant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

While the veine laſts, ye ſhall ſee them out-doe and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the ſoundeſt Chriſtians. While the ague-fitt is upon them, they have an higher colour and more heate, then the well complexioned right ſanguine Chriſtian, that has much and good blood in him;

                  <p>The Reader will pardon me, that I exemplifie theſe points with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:155614:15"/>Hiſtories and other inſtances, ſo frequently, when he ſhall conſider, that ſuch a Diſcourſe and Treatiſe as this, is moſt properly made up of obſervations. But to the point in hand: for my part I confeſſe, that where grace dwels in the heart, ſhe will be Miſtreſſe, and will diſpoſe of all things, not onely within, but without doores too, and will have a modeſt ſigne, a comely plaine front; She cannot endure to dwell, as it were in an Ale-houſe with red lattices and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhly painted poſts. Grace is a commanding thing, and will have ſober haire and ſober garments; as (if I remember right) I have heard it was old M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Dod,</hi> who anſwered a friend that demanded of him, why he cried not out againſt Gaſlants that wore long haire, that if he could preach Chriſt into their hearts, they would of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cut their haire. 'Twas a grave and right anſwer, becomming ſo experienced and godly a Divine, if it were he, or if not, I doe him no wrong to faſten it upon him. I know, Grace is the beſt law againſt vanity, againſt flaunting. Yet an affected out-ſide is commonly ſuſpitious. I once perſwaded a good woman to leave off a ſingular dreſſe, when I told her we muſt live like ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but muſt goe dreſt like our neighbours. It becomes no man to have a ſpeaking habit, it wins nothing to God, it expoſeth the godly often to deriſion. Weare your band and your hat, and any thing elſe, as others doe, ſo they be not exorbitant. Yee have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough beſides to make yee knowne what ye are, namely, to let all that converſe with you find, that yee are holy and juſt and honeſt in all dealings.

This fact of his, carrying ſo much ſhew of ſelf-deniall and mortification, took ſo much with the <hi>Order,</hi> that they changed their Name, and cal'd themſelves <hi>Theatines</hi> from him. And who would not have counted him a miracle of holineſſe? But the world afterward took notice, that he contemned leſſer preferments to procure greater; for he that refuſed <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> yet gladly accepted a <hi>Cardinalſhip</hi> at the firſt offer from <hi>Pope Paul the third;</hi> ſo that his <hi>Title</hi> which was taken before for the gracing of an <hi>Order,</hi> was uſed afterward ordinarily for the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of an hypocrite.

To conclude, what elſe ſhall we call that pretenſe of ſome that they deſire preferment, only that they may be more inabled to doe more good; then plain hypocriſie? for he that doth not much good, to the extent of his power, in the eſtate wherein he is for the preſent though meane; doth but pretend he would be better, if he were preferred to an higher condition.</p>

'Tis a known ſtory, <hi>Judas</hi> was a covetous wretch, but one would think he were an holy man, an enemy to vaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes, a great friend to the poore, brim-full of charity: When the humble ſinner beſtowed her coſtly ſweet ointment, where ſhe

<note place="margin">Mat. 23.4.</note> They would not move thoſe burthens with one of their fingers. Such are Preachers (if there be any ſuch, as it is likely ſuch there be) when

                  <p>This is to be an Hypocrite, whereas ſuch as are ſincere are ready to doe more themſelves then they urge upon others; as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>THere is another <hi>Symptome</hi> of Hypocriſie conſiderable about this outward profeſſion, when men follow Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Hypocrites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad onely in fair weather.</note> while the <hi>loaves</hi> are to be had, and goe a long with him, ſo long as faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laſts; but are loath to looſe any thing by Religion, or to endure the <hi>wetting</hi> with and for Chriſt. A <hi>Scribe</hi> comes to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See, 2 Mach. 6.21.</note> 8.19, 20. and ſaith, <hi>Maſter I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goest.</hi> But we heare no more of him, after Chriſt had <hi>cooled</hi> him with this anſwer, <hi>The Foxes have holes and the birds of the ayre have neſts, but the ſonne of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> 'Tis thought by good Interpreters, that he ſuppoſed he ſhould have found a better ſervice, and repented of his forward profer. Such <hi>Snailes</hi> as theſe come abroad in the <hi>dew,</hi> but afterward <hi>creepe</hi> in againe. If they perceive the aire to thicken, and the Clouds to grow blacke for raine, they houſe themſelves, and get backe againe, though their feet were over the threſhold, and they had begun their journey. They love not <hi>dirty way</hi> nor <hi>stormy weather;</hi> they are with the forwardeſt, when the <hi>garments</hi> and the <hi>palme-branches</hi> are ſpread, and the people cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to <hi>tryumphing</hi> Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Mark. 14.51, 52.</note> but they ſlinke away when he is led to <hi>Calvery.</hi> If once the ſwords and ſtaves appeare, they will rather leave their linnen garments and runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way naked, then be taken with him.

                  <p>He that is ſincere to Gods cauſe, loves it whatever becomes of it,
<note place="margin">Hypocrites fall in with the winning ſide.</note> but the Hypocrite he chuſes and cleaves only to the ſtrong and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:155614:29"/>ſide; and therefore ordinarily may be obſerved to ſtand <hi>in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> expecting the event, that he may apply his deſignes for Religion accordingly as things fall out; as we reade of <hi>Gelon</hi> King of <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who when there was <hi>warre</hi> betweene the <hi>Grecians</hi> and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> (as they cal'd them) kept his <hi>Embaſſadours</hi> at <hi>Delphos</hi> a neuter City, to await the iſſue, and to be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate the victor,

A man may carry things ſo evenly in other matters, that he may be ſafe by moderation, what ever the event be, carrying if not an equall, yet a ſober affection to either; but into the buſineſſe of Religion we muſt caſt our ſelves with reſolution, as <hi>Peter</hi> threw himſelfe into the ſea, ſinke or ſwim, he meant to come to Chriſt. Such a teſtimony <hi>Muſculus</hi> gave of his ſincerity to the truth he had entertained.
<note place="margin">Melch.

He continued there a painfull and conſtant Preacher of the Goſpell. Here indeed is the tryall, the hypocrite loves not Religion ſo well, to venture ſo hard for it and with it.

                  <p>But let me cleare this point a little further before I leave it.
<note place="margin">Hypocrits may be ſufferers.</note> I doe not take <hi>ſuffering</hi> in the cauſe, to be alwaies an undoubted te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ſincerity to it. For to make this diſcovery yet fuller, an hypocrite may be a ſufferer, I meane when vain-glory and popular favour doth ſuſtaine him; for then though he endure heavy cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and thoſe cenſures cruelly executed, yet he is all this while the conquerour, and rides in the head of the Troopes of his admirers and applauders, though it be on a ſcaffold or a gibbet or at a ſtake.

                     <hi>Auguſtines</hi> obſervation: <q>Doe yee thinke (ſaith he) there may not be ſome that would ſuffer only for the praiſe of men? If there were not ſuch kind of men, the Apoſtle would not have ſaid,</q> 
                     <hi>Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, I am nothing.</hi> There may be ſome therefore that may doe this, rather through boaſting then out of love.

                     </note> with the words of a learned Divine, ſome through heat of bloud or greatneſſe of ſpirit adventurous, or otherwiſe prodigall of life for purchaſe of ſame, can with joy imbrace ſuch dangers in Chriſts cauſe, as would much daunt many good profeſſours. In perſwaſions of zeale hence grounded, they might perhaps dye in battell againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> or in the <hi>Romiſh Inquiſition,</hi> and yet do no more for the Saviour of their ſoules, then they would for a ſtrumpet or ſome conſort of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:155614:30"/>luſt, or then malefactors have done one for another. And it is a miſerable kind of Martyrdome, to ſacrifice a ſtout body to a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne mind. So then, that ſaying which hath gone current through all Antiquity, That it is not the ſuffering but the cauſe which makes a Martyr, will hold good ſtill, and juſtifie our obſervation, that ſome ſufferers may be no Martyrs.</p>
                  <p>But this was taken notice of only by the way,
<note place="margin">Hypocrites wil not venture their vvhole ſtocke.</note> but the ſymptome that we were now looking upon was, that ordinarily the hypocrite will not venture his <hi>whole-ſtocke</hi> upon Gods cauſe, and which I alſo adde, he is loath to be at any coſt in Gods ſervice, or to looſe any thing by his profeſſion.

All theſe are unwilling to follow Chriſt, when they muſt part with their comforts, with their eaſe, with their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. They could be content to live by the truth, but cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the truth ſhould live upon them. If it come to that, that the Goſpell will not mtintaine them, but they it, and that they muſt looſe a good trade, good cuſtomers, good friends, great mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> farewell ſo unthriving, ſo unprofitable a profeſſion.

                     <hi>Judas</hi> was an hypocrite, and thought all was waſte that was beſtowed upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But in the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> we find hypocrites to be liberall, and to offer largely, they thinke not great things too much, burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, calves of a yeare old, thouſands of Ramms, ten thouſand ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of oyl, yea the firſt-born, the fruit of the body.</p>

Such men ſerve not Gods will, but their owne choice; They make a difference of the Tables, as if only one ſide were of Gods writing; as if both had not the ſame equall authority.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome that ſeeme to have a care of the firſt Table, they will heare frequently, pray in their Family, hate Idols, avoyd raſh oathes, keepe the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but have little of no regard of the ſecond, but live in malice, covetouſneſſe, oppreſſion, ſlandering, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon why <hi>Hypocrites</hi> boaſt of the works of the <hi>firſt Table,</hi> which are Adoration and duty towards God, is double, both becauſe ſuch works have a greater pompe and demonſtration of Holineſſe, and alſo, becauſe they do leſſe croſſe their affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. The Apoſtle takes this way to convict hypocrites, by ſending them from the works of ſacrifice to the works of mercy, which are the works of diſtinction, whereby to find out hypocrites, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Pure Relegion and undefiled with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this; to viſit the fatherleſſe and widowes in their afflictions.</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:155614:31"/>Others are ſecond Table men, they deale juſtly, they obey laws, they are liberall to the poore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they care not for Religion, they condemne all forwardneſſe, as a ſilly preciſeneſſe, they come to Church and heare drouſily, careleſly; they care not for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but count it a wearineſſe unto them, eſpecially to heare twice and to performe the other duties of the day, and are ready to thinke of it, as profanely as one of late writ of it, who after he hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the practiſe of ſome, whom he condemnes for <hi>Preciſians,</hi> in their preparatory duties, publick Church duties, private Family duties, and ſecret duties of that day, ſaith, <hi>It is ſuch a toyle as that he would not put his horſe to it.</hi> Some will performe eaſie duties, but paſſe by the difficult; they are forward in applauded, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended duties, but ſlarinke from ſuch as are leſſe accounted of, or expoſed to more cenſure. But this indeed is not to ſerve God at all, when God is not ſerved fully; which appeares by that cenſure given by the Holy Ghoſt in the pen of the writer of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Kings,</hi> concerning the ſtrange Nations which planted in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria;
<note place="margin">2 Kin. 17.33, 34.</note> They feared the Lord and ſerved their owne gods after their owne manner, they feared not the Lord.</hi> Their feare of the Lord was no feare.
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28.</note> So their Religion is no Religion, who abhorre Idols, and yet commit ſacriledge, as the Apoſtle inſtanceth; who throw downe <hi>Baals Temple,</hi>

                     <hi>Iſrael</hi> knew not the way to the holy Land, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeakes, and therefore had a <hi>pillar</hi> and a <hi>cloud;</hi> but now is the time when faith is required, ſignes are gone. Gods way to life is a plain way, but men that will not mind ſalvation, pretend either want of meanes, or that they are not cleare, or that they are not powerfully adminiſtred. The method is perplexed, the notions are cloudy, the Preacher wants life, the matter is not wholeſome, the delivery is with affectation, Somewhat or other it is, if they knew what, that lies in their way; when indeed 'tis their owne unſoundneſſe, they will not underſtand, they will not obey. They ſhould doe well and thrive, if they were under another Miniſtery; a more powerfull Miniſtery, a more godly Miniſtery. I grant 'tis a great helpe, and the people are happy that have a powerfull, a godly Miniſter. But it may be poſſible that a <hi>lame man</hi> that ſits ſtill himſelfe, may with his very <hi>crutch</hi> point out to thee the right way; take heed that hypocriſie lurke not in thy ſoule, when being unwilling to take paines to goe, thou complaineſt thou art not ſure of the way. Examine thou the doctrine thou receiveſt, though thou receiveſt it from a <hi>Phariſees</hi> mouth, and if it be good obey it. If thy ſuit be neatly made, and fit thy body, put it on, though the <hi>Taylor</hi> that made it, be <hi>crook'd backt</hi> and an unhandſome fellow. Take heed of ſhifts and excuſes. But if my Miniſter were a man of abler parts, clearer notions, richer gifts, I ſhould profit by him. This is but the <hi>colouring</hi> of thy <hi>proud hypocriſie.</hi> It is God whom thou heareſt, thou drinkeſt of his waters, what if they runne to thee through an <hi>Earthen pipe.</hi> 't is God who opens the heart, the Miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is but the <hi>key,</hi> what if the key be not made of gold.

<note place="margin">Hypocrits give not due honour to all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> Hypocrites give not their due honour unto all Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; they make a difference of them; they are for ſome, and others they neglect. Many regard preaching, but they care not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:155614:32"/>for prayer. Others are for prayer, but they ſlight the preaching of the word: yet theſe two different branches, doe both ſpring from the ſame ſtock. 'Tis hypocriſie that makes men all for hearing, which is (to ſome) the eaſie duty, while they know not how to frame their ſpirits to prayer, which requires the labour of the ſoul, the exerciſe of humiliation and brokenneſſe of ſpirit. 'Tis hypocriſie which makes other men all for prayer, which is (to ſome) the eaſie duty, while they make it but as the repeating of a leſſon; while they regard not preaching, which brings the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching word too much home unto them.

                  <p>I will adde unto theſe one other inſtance, There are ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enough in publick, but care not to ſet up the Ordinances at home, I meane, in family-prayer, and that happy but much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and much diſcountenanced exerciſe of mutuall conference, of ſpeaking oft together, as it is in <hi>Malachy,</hi> and exhorting one another to love and to good works. A practiſe ſo conſonant to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> doctrine, that I wonder any ſhould be ſo profane as to diſlike. And truely this is one of the great diſcoveries of unſound and unfruitfull hearers, that no fruit at any time appeares in their diſcourſe. And here I will take occaſion to give his due honour to him who gave me life, that among many other graces that made him ſhine in his private condition, this was one, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable of, and moſt profitable in private conference. He and ſome ſelect friends, judicious and godly private Chriſtians, kept conſtantly one day in a fort-night, in courſe, at their ſeverall hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to conferre ſometimes about wholſome <hi>Caſes</hi> of conſcience, ſometimes upon <hi>choſen heads</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> ſometimes upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Points,</hi> according as they propounded the matter to be treated upon ſtill at their next meeting, and then had a <hi>Supper</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under a law of temperance, and a penalty if any ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his proviſions. This practiſe I obſerved in my <hi>Father</hi> and his <hi>Friends</hi> for many yeares, and I note to commend it unto the imitation of others, as a notable meanes of their ſpirituall thriving. I am ſure his profit by it was great, I find the fruits of it among his papers, where many queſtions are ſo judiciouſly, ſo fully, ſo clearely reſolved, that they were worthy to be communicated; as verifying that <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> in a ſpirituall ſenſe, <hi>The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hand makes rich;</hi> and that of the <hi>Apoſtle, God giveth grace to the humble;</hi> and that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, God reveales his ſecret to them that feare him.</hi> This courſe I ſuppoſe he took from the counſell of that reverend Father and much experienced Divine, old M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p>Adde to theſe ſuch as make the Pulpit a ſtage of Sedition; I have ever ſuſpected thoſe that unneceſſarily tell the people of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the State, and the miſtakes of government; for <hi>cui bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no?</hi> To what purpoſe is it that the people muſt needs be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their obſervations.

'Tis indeed highly commendable, when God brings a Preacher to ſtand before Princes, to take courage, and in Gods
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:155614:37"/>name to reprove what is amiſſe.

                     </note> The Scripture ſpeaking of a <hi>faith unfaigned</hi> or without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, implies that there is an hypocriticall and <hi>fained faith.</hi> Many have unripe and ungrounded perſwaſions that they have faith, and ſo doe themſelves much hurt.

For as the <hi>Heathen</hi> at firſt refuſed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe of his meaneneſſe, and becauſe they were bred and brought up to another profeſſion, ſo now many enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:155614:39"/>the faith becauſe they are born to it, and becauſe it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion accompanied with riches and proſperity, and countenanced by publike Laws and the favour of Princes, and becauſe 'tis the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and profeſſion of the Country they draw their firſt breath in. Thus many have no more ground for their profeſſion of faith,
<note place="margin">

                     </note> then a <hi>Turke</hi> hath for his who is bred up in the reverence of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and is therefore zealous for him. The greateſt number of men are <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants</hi> upon theſe tearmes, without tryall or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the difference of faiths. So that their faith is not choyce but a kind of hap: not an acquiſition but a kind of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance that they enter upon in ſucceſſion after their fathers. And certainly he that is of the faith of Chriſt, for neighbourhood, for birth-ſake, for cuſtom, for conformity with others, for the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of publike liberty, eaſe, enjoyment of places and offices, and the like, would as eaſily be of another faith, upon the like tearms, or forſake this. Well; ye profeſſe the <hi>Chriſtian faith</hi> in diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Proteſtant faith</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Proteſtant holy faith,</hi> in diſtinction to <hi>Proteſtants at large;</hi> But what operation hath it upon you? No faith argues one good and ſound, unleſſe the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it worke upon the heart and make it ſound and good.
<note place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> For true faith is a worker out of hypocriſie, it <hi>purifies the heart.</hi> Now it may be more ſafe to profeſſe the faith then it was in the <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times,</hi> for then perſecutions, reproaches, confiſcations, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, martyrdoms attended the faith, the <hi>front</hi> of the <hi>Battel</hi> was againſt them. But yet now 'tis as hard to be ſincere in the faith as then; for if men profeſſe the faith according to <hi>Christs rule,</hi> in oppoſition to the corrupt cuſtoms and practiſes of evill men, he makes himſelfe a prey, and meets with thoſe dangers that they did of old; and hereby it is that many diſcover the faigning and counterfeiting of faith, that they run the ſame courſe in their lives with the moſt evill and profane.</p>
                  <p>Again what doe men talke of faith, when they are partiall and unſound in obedience? for true faith equally reſpects all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. It is the <hi>ſoul of obedience;</hi> the reaſon or internall law of the mind which ſets all on worke, and preſents unto men the whole <hi>royalty</hi> of the Law,
<note place="margin">James 2.8.</note> it breaks inordinate paſſions, it rebates and turns the violence of contrary inclinations, it perſwades above
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:155614:39"/>all oratory, it takes men captives and delivers them into the hand of Chriſt, that they become a <hi>ruled people</hi> and walke after his Law; And theſe are the men that doe firmely believe Gods mercy in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There are many dreamers, that have ſtrange phantaſies; <hi>They are ſure they ſhall be ſaved.</hi> I once met with a man in ſuch a <hi>dreame,</hi> he was full of aſſurance, I that knew him very well, and knew nothing that could make him ſo confident, dealt with him as I ſaw moſt convenient for his eſtate, and endeavoured to <hi>prick</hi> his <hi>bladder</hi> that he might vent that wind, and urged him with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure;</hi> and with that other place, <hi>Worke out your ſalvation with ſeare and trembling.</hi> He was ſtartled, and at length told me, <hi>I acted the Devills part againſt him to make him deſpaire.</hi> Beloved the deceit is dangerous. 'Tis not ſo eaſie to believe mercy as men dreame. Beliefe anſwers in proportion to fidelity to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. So much ſincere faithfullneſſe, ſo much beliefe. For faith, is an <hi>obedientiall affiance,</hi> an <hi>obſequious confidence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither is the hope that many have or pretend to have,
<note place="margin">Sandy hope of hypocrites.</note> any founder then their faith. If there were a true hope of the coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there would be a true preparation to give him meeting; a ſighing and longing after him, even with the very languiſhing of the heart, according to that of <hi>Solomon,
<note place="margin">Prov. 13.12. Rom. 8.</note> Hope deferred makes the heart ſick:</hi> a groaning within our ſelves, waiting for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our bodies. But hypocrites think themſelves well here, and care not for changing: there would be a ſweet joy in the ſoule,
<note place="margin">Rom 5.2.</note> a rejoycing under the hope of the glory of God, a rejoycing with joy unſpeakeable and full of glory; but hypocrites rejoyce here, and have contentment enough if the world ſmile upon them. There would be an endeavour after holineſſe, according to that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John, He that hath this hope purifieth himſelfe even as God is pure;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3 2.</note> But hypocrites wallow in their impurity, and have no regard to be like <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or fitted for thoſe holy Heavens into which no uncleane thing muſt enter.

There would be a ſollicititude to promote all the meanes of attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this expectation, a diligence to remove all that might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments; But hypocrites hope to come to Heaven, and yet ſet on the journey in the way of life.

But the hypocrite hath a cloſe arbour, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate poſtern to let in other lovers. Thoſe that entertaine Chriſt, but ſet him not in the higheſt roome, or ſet others by him, or bring into the ſame place ſuch companions as he loathes, or ſuffer him to be diſquieted with the noiſe and the revellings and loud cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the next chamber, or enquire not of his ſervants his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, what he loves, what he likes, what will pleaſe him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how can they ſay they love him?

This conceit prevailed betimes in the Church, they thought God could not well be ſerved at his Altar by married perſons. <hi>Hiſtories</hi> are full of the pure and chaſt pretenſes of thoſe that have been the great patrons of <hi>Monkery</hi> and the <hi>Caelibate</hi> of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> but withall they are full of the lewd pranks of thoſe egregious hypocrites. Our <hi>Chronicles</hi> tell us of a <hi>Roman Legate</hi> that after he had in <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>London</hi> ſpoken gloriouſly of chaſtity, was the ſame night after to his great ſhame taken in bed with an whore. But if the reader would have plenty of examples to this purpoſe, let him reade <hi>Biſhop Bale,</hi> for I ſpare to cite them. <hi>Bayly a french Jeſuit,</hi> beſtows much foule language upon our Proteſtant Married Miniſters, and calls them <hi>Stallions, rutting Bucks,</hi> and <hi>Salacious Boares.</hi> But beſides the <hi>Learned Rivet</hi> who hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken him, we have that cauſe ſufficiently and learnedly vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by one of our own writers.

But are you in earneſt ſaid <hi>Langius,</hi> for many cloake their private griefe under the publike.

If thou beeſt ſincere in it, I am ſure few are ſo. Moſt are like <hi>Polus</hi> the <hi>Stage-player,</hi> who when he was to act a weeping part, wept indeed over the aſhes of his own ſon. When a Town is on fire all are buſie to quench it, but 'tis their own private houſes that their care is for. Thou art troubled that <hi>Belgia</hi> is waſted with Warre: yet if thou heareſt of a cruell warre in the <hi>Indies,</hi> thou art not troubled. If thy ſorrow were for publike calamity, thou wouldſt be moved for that; but now thy trouble is that it is in <hi>Belgia,</hi> that is, becauſe it is neare thee, and thou art concerned in it. Tell me, if thou couldſt be aſſured and put out of all doubt, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:155614:50"/>thy houſe and money and all thy eſtate ſhould be ſafe in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall loſſe and vaſtation; wouldſt thou yet grieve? What you would doe I know not; but many in ſuch a caſe would feed their eyes with delight in others calamities. At leaſtwiſe his griefe that ſtands ſafe upon the ſhoare and ſees a ſhipwrack, is nothing to his that hath loſt his goods in the wreake and is himſelf ſtrugling with the waves. There is one other particular which I will yet inſtance, the pretended <hi>zeale</hi> that ſome have for <hi>Reformation,</hi> when with all their hearts they could be content that nothing were reformed. <hi>Luther</hi> found this in the <hi>Pope,</hi>

And in truth, that pretenſe proved but a <hi>foxe-trick,</hi> for the <hi>Reformation</hi> vaniſhed into ſmoake.</p>
                  <p>I have been the longer about the examination of this grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is none ſo much and ſo ordinarily counterfeited: for though ſome errors of zeale ſhew themſelves in ſuch as are not otherwiſe ill affected but want knowledge, and are well meaning but ignorant, like the <hi>Batts</hi> that convert the <hi>Chryſt all in humour</hi> of the eye to make large wings, and ſo fly and flutter abroad, but are blind, and in others that have good affection, but have not digeſted things throughly, in whom there may be a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heate,

<note place="margin">Hypocrites diſcovered by ſtrong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> who carry it fairely, having no occaſion to make them diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; I will offer this <hi>obſervation</hi> briefely, That an hypocrite is not able to reſiſt a <hi>ſtrong tentation.</hi> The influence and ſeaſoning of his <hi>education</hi> may carry him on a great way and a great while, that he may act the <hi>temperate</hi> man, the <hi>devout</hi> man, notably for ſome reſpects that he hath, till ſome ſtronger occaſion take him off. We have known ſome that for a moneth, for half a yeare, for a yeare, or it may be a longer time, have been reſtrained by the priſon of good ſocietie, and other regards, but at length could hold no longer, but have broken looſe and flowen out into all diſorder. 'Tis a witty and pleaſant <hi>Fable</hi> that <hi>Lucian</hi> hath of an <hi>Aegyptian King,</hi> who cauſed ſome <hi>Apes</hi> when they were young to dance and keep their poſtures with much art, theſe he would put into <hi>rich-coates,</hi> and have them in ſome great preſence to dance to the admiration of ſuch as knew them not, what little ſort of active nimble men the <hi>King</hi> had got; and of ſuch as knew them, that they ſhould be trained up to ſo manlike and handſom a deportment; but a ſuttle fellow that was once admitted to ſee them, brought with him and took out of his boſome an handfull of <hi>Nutts,</hi> which he threw among them; they perceiving that which they naturally loved, preſently left off their dance, fell to ſcrambling, tore one anothers rich coates, and to the deriſion of the beholders who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly admired them, they ſhewed themſelves to be right <hi>Apes,</hi> though they had been cloathed, and taught their poſtures like to men. Throw in the nutts among hypocrites, and you ſhall ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what they are. They may act it handſomely while no better trade is open for them; and that they find religious correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie to be their <hi>thriving way,</hi> their beſt gaine. But let ſome ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger love beſiege them, they run out unto it, forget their parts, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:155614:51"/>make ſport, or rather cauſe griefe in the godly minded that were deceived in them. 'Tis ſo in others too, that are men of ſmooth behaviour, and no harme to be diſcerned by them; but being <hi>Guns</hi> full <hi>charged</hi> with the <hi>powder</hi> of rancarous malice, and the <hi>bullets</hi> of a ſharpe, imbittered and boyſterous ſpirit, and hard <hi>rammed</hi> with habituated reſolution, <hi>diſcharg</hi> upon you with much violence, as ſoon as the fire comes to them: Let there be but a tentation, and ye ſhall ſee what is within them.</p>

<note place="margin">Jer. 5.3.</note> hee refuſes to receive correction, but makes his face harder then a rock.</hi> When King <hi>Jehoram</hi> and the two Kings his Auxiliaries were brought into a ſtraight, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliſha</hi> labours to convince him of his ſin,
<note place="margin">2 King. 3.13.</note>

'Tis an hard matter to make an hypocrite ſee his ſin. There were ſome in the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> time,
<note place="margin">Jer. 44.17, 18.</note> who would not be brought to underſtand the true cauſes of the miſery they ſuffered. It was not their burning incenſe unto the <hi>frame of Heaven,</hi> (an ordinary <hi>Eastern</hi> practiſe of Idolatry.) No, by no meanes, not that. They even quarrell
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:155614:51"/>the Prophet for touching upon that. There is ſtill ſome other <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> that ſhakes and beats the Ship.

                     <note place="margin">Hoſ 10.4.</note> and the ſtring ſoon ſlips again. They will ſpeake words, like <hi>profane Marriners</hi> that fall to prayer in a ſtorme, and make great vowes,
<note place="margin">1 Kin. 21.27. Pſal. 78.34, 35, 36, 37.</note> but they ſweare falſly in making a Covenant. In ſuch caſes very <hi>Ahabs</hi> will put on ſack-cloth.

                  <p n="1">1. Hypocriſie is a <hi>prognoſtick</hi> of the <hi>decay of gifts.</hi> It eates out a mans gifts, at leaſt the ſpirit and livelineſſe of them. Nothing hinders ſpirituall growth and flouriſhing more then that doth. <hi>Sincerity</hi> is a fat and yeilding ſoyle wherein all graces take root and grow proſperouſly. God is ſtrong with the upright. <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> though he were timerous was ſincere, and came on mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly. He was a weake and tender ſprig when he was firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he grew in the ſhade, he came to <hi>Jeſus</hi> by night. But he grew
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:155614:57"/>up, and feared no ſcorchings, no froſts, no winds. This timerous diſciple, becomes a confident profeſſor. When Chriſt was deſpiſed of all, and hung upon the Croſſe among thieves, he comes boldly, and beggs the body of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But the hypocrite growes weaker and weaker, and loſes all. <hi>Boner</hi> was once a good Preacher,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> Acts and Mon.</note> but at laſt himſelf confeſſed he had loſt his gift of preaching. Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <hi>Sanders,</hi> ſincere <hi>Sanders,</hi> proves a brave glorious <hi>Martyr;</hi> but bold <hi>Pendleton,</hi> that preſumptuous and bragging hypocrite becomes a baſe <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> and to ſave his fat carcaſſe from frying at a ſtake which hee formerly vaunted of, hee carried a leane and ſtarved ſoul to Hell, unleſſe God gave him repentance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, which is more then we find of him. So truly is that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> verified, <hi>A little that a rightcous man hath,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.16.</note> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the riches of many wicked.</hi> That little encreaſeth to a rich ſtock, for ſincerity is a great improver; but that riches is blown away and comes to extreame poverty. The hypocrite is fit for no duty. He is a <hi>cup</hi> with an <hi>hole</hi> in the bottome, he can hold nothing, he is fit for no uſe, but to be lay'd by or thrown in a corner. An hypocrite cannot pray. He can ſpeake <hi>confeſſion</hi> and <hi>petition,</hi> and with good words too it may be; for words are the worke of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which he may ſtill hold, God lets out theſe common grounds to wicked men, and they may till them: but he wants an <hi>heart,</hi> and 'tis the heart that prayes. And prayer is the holding of acquaintance with God, to whom the hypocrite is a ſtranger; and the driving of a trade with God, who will not deale with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, or truſt out any of his ſpeciall graces to them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. One cauſe of Hypocriſie in ſome is, that they took up a courſe of profeſſion of Religion upon <hi>ſleight grounds,</hi> never being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted. They are <hi>cloth</hi> not well <hi>wrought</hi> in the <hi>loome,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſhrinke,</hi> and neither weare <hi>well</hi> nor <hi>long.</hi> They began un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundly in Religion; their hearts being never throughly broken and humbled. That man who is brought to a full ſight of his ſins, and ſenſe of his ſtate, and to ſee that he needs Chriſt or elſe muſt periſh without him, and is <hi>ſet up</hi> by Chriſt, and hath received grace from him; he it is that will live unto him. The broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted penitent comes to be the moſt faithfull and obſequious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Such a one knows what he oweth to Chriſt, how much he is beholding to him,
<note place="margin">2 King. 18.6.</note> and counts him a <hi>good Master</hi> with whom he will ſtay for ever, he will cleave to the Lord, and not depart from following him, as it was ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> But for hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
<note place="margin">Job 17.9.</note> they never gave themſelves fully up to God: they never throughly waſhed their hearts and hands, and therefore they hold not on their way; but whereas he <hi>that hath cleane hands waxeth ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> theſe doe more and more decay. Many of theſe have unripe reſolutions, they ſet on too forwardly, before they are trained up and acquainted with the wayes of God.
<note place="margin">Senec. <hi>Ep.</hi> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Grace</hi> is among thoſe rare things that <hi>laſt long,</hi> but <hi>ripen leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:155614:66"/>Such as will be in the <hi>Accidence</hi> before they are out of the <hi>Primmar,</hi> never reade well. Hypocrites were not well <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,</hi> the foundation was not well and ſurely layed, the truth had not rooting in them. Truly this is a great miſchiefe and miſery, we obſerve it in many, that take up Religion for ends, or by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or through imitation, or upon ſome ſudden acquaintance with ſome notions that for the preſent win upon mens good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, like ſome people that will be preſently acquainted and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and become <hi>ſworn brothers;</hi> but 'tis a <hi>frothy amitie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun it may be in one <hi>Tavern</hi> and will end in the next. Many there are that being well and religiouſly educated, <hi>civilized</hi> and more then ſo, <hi>habituated</hi> to the practiſes of Religion, miſtake themſelves at firſt it may be, and think it is out of choice and love that they take that way which their fathers went, and themſelves went with them in their hand, when 'tis indeed but <hi>custome</hi> and <hi>uſe.</hi> Others when they firſt ſet out meet with good <hi>neighbours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> and <hi>friends,</hi> who carry them along with them, and ſo they become <hi>religious</hi> for <hi>company;</hi> now 'tis eaſie for all theſe to prove hypocrites, being ſo unſound in their firſt <hi>undertakings</hi> and the <hi>grounds</hi> of it. This is I ſuppoſe the moſt ordinary cauſe. Others there are that are ſet by their <hi>Parents</hi> to the <hi>trade</hi> of <hi>profeſſion,</hi> as ſome children are put out to <hi>trades</hi> that they have no mind or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination unto; who are in a manner forced to follow thoſe <hi>trades,</hi> becauſe they have no skill in any others, but they prove but <hi>bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> and ſeldome thrive in them; ſo it is with ſuch as are religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly brought up, but their hearts are not ſeaſoned with it, they prove hypocrites, they <hi>keep up</hi> that <hi>profeſſion,</hi> but are but <hi>bunglers</hi> in it, and grow not <hi>rich in grace;</hi> yet they muſt make as <hi>faire a ſhew</hi> as they can, leſt if they <hi>breake,</hi> or but give occaſion to have their <hi>states ſuſpected,</hi> they loſe their <hi>reputation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are others I believe that are more wicked, that begin to ſet up in religion out of worſe reſpects, that have <hi>skill</hi> enough to turne themſelves to many <hi>trades,</hi> but find this to be moſt for their advantage, to bring them <hi>custom,</hi> to beget <hi>reputation,</hi> to bind ſome good friends unto them, and ſo become religious for <hi>ends.</hi> But all theſe ſorts are alike in this, that they are <hi>reeds growing in ſands,</hi> and are not ſolid as <hi>oakes,</hi> but fild with a <hi>light pith,</hi> whence it is that they can neither be laſting nor ſtrong. And all of them are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:155614:67"/>like that <hi>young man</hi> we reade of, that was haſty it ſeems to follow Chriſt, he had a <hi>linnen cloth caſt about his naked body,</hi> it ſeems he took not time to <hi>dreſſe</hi> himſelf.
<note place="margin">Mar. 14.51, 52.</note> 
                     <hi>And the men layd hold on him, and he left the linnen cloth,</hi> and when Chriſt was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and in trouble, he fled away <hi>naked.</hi> Theſe men that ſtay not, nor regard to be throughly <hi>dreſſed,</hi> but put on the <hi>looſe garment</hi> of Religion, no marvaile they diſcover themſelves hypocrites, and <hi>flip it off</hi> againe if occaſion ſerve, that they may ſcape danger, which they will not engage themſelves in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond cauſe of hypocriſie is, becauſe men know not God, and they want faith.
<note place="margin">Icr. 9.3, 4, 5, 6.</note> In the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> we find this very cauſe, why men are not valiant for the truth upon the earth, <hi>They know now not me; ſaith the Lord;</hi> and thence it is alſo that they ſupplant their bretheren and walk with their neighbours with ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 9.10.</note> and teach their toungs to ſpeake lyes; <hi>Through deceit they refuſe to know me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> If men knew Gods Name, they would put their truſt in him, and obſerve him, and live to him. 'Tis becauſe that this faith or truſt in God is not rightly planted in their hearts, that men are ſo uneven in their courſes, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much to their baſe and unworthy <hi>ſhifts</hi> and <hi>complyings</hi> with others.
<note place="margin">Zeph. 3 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>They that truſt in the Name of the Lord will not doe iniquitie or ſpeake lies, nor ſhall a deceitfull tongue be found in their mouthes, for they ſhall feed and lie downe and none ſhall make them afraid,</hi> as it is in the Prophet <hi>Zephanie.</hi> This truſting we ſee cures thoſe things that put men to their ſhifts, they would feed and be at eaſe and be ſecure, and that it may be ſo they are for any way or courſe to advantage thoſe ends, and therefore will <hi>flatter, comply</hi> and be <hi>any thing</hi> with <hi>any ſide:</hi> but truſt makes them conſtant unto God from whom they are aſſured of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſafety. But the moſt of men have not this truſt in God, as doth appeare when it comes to the tryall. They believe <hi>generalities,</hi> that God <hi>Is,</hi> and that he is a <hi>rewarder of them that ſeeke him,</hi> and that it is <hi>better to obey God then man;</hi> yet they faile in the particulars, becauſe their <hi>aſſent</hi> unto theſe is <hi>weake.</hi> They aſſent unto theſe propoſitions as being <hi>true</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> while they are conſidered <hi>abstractly</hi> and in the abſence of other <hi>good</hi> or <hi>tentations</hi> to the contrary; but their <hi>aſſent</hi> is not well rooted to hold them firmely unto them, when they ſee <hi>hopes</hi> of more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:155614:67"/>in another courſe, and more profit in another ſervice. Hence it is that contrary affections of <hi>Feare, Hope, Love,</hi> and the like, get head againſt this aſſent, and make a <hi>Major-part</hi> againſt it; and ſo that truſt or aſſent like a weake <hi>King</hi> may <hi>exhort,</hi> but cannot <hi>command</hi> in them.

<note place="margin">Hypocriſie cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by an wholſome and ſearching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. Hoſ. 6.5. Ezek. 3.17.</note> BEcauſe hypocriſie is cauſed by an unſound entrance into the profeſſion of Religion; attend upon the <hi>Ordinance</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>thorough Converſion,</hi> the word in the <hi>powerfull Miniſtry</hi> of it, which ſerves for the convincing of the ſoule; the word in the mouth of the Prophets, which <hi>cuts</hi> and <hi>hewes</hi> the conſcience. The <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſet his Prophets to be <hi>watch-men</hi> to receive the word at his mouth, and to warne men from him, that they may ſave their lives;
<note place="margin">1 Kin. 6.7.</note> to be <hi>worke-men</hi> to uſe their <hi>hammers</hi> and <hi>axes</hi> and <hi>tooles</hi> of iron, for men are not as the <hi>ſtones</hi> for the <hi>Temple</hi> made ready before, but muſt be hewed and ſmoothed by their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery. Submit your ſelves to their miniſtery, to the edge of their word,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note> to the ſharpe law preached for the awaking and rowſing the ſleepy conſcience, the unbroken heart. Wait on the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the Law, which will worke in you the <hi>knowledge</hi> of your <hi>eſtates</hi> and of ſinne, that the ſecrets of your hearts may be made manifeſt, that yee may fall downe on your faces and worſhip God,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.35. Heb. 4.12.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that God is in them that ſpeake. Receive the wound of that <hi>ſharpe</hi> and <hi>two-edged-Sword,</hi> which pierceth between the <hi>joynts</hi> and <hi>marrow,</hi> which pricketh the heart;
<note place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> that Word which beates the ſoule from all her <hi>ſubtill ſhifts,</hi> waſhes off her <hi>colours</hi> and <hi>daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings,</hi> convinceth her thoroughly, ſhews her what a deſperate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhe is in while ſhe ſerves ſinne, but that the ſervice of God is perfect freedome. The man that is thus convinced knows what he doth, when he enters into Chriſts ſervice, and having his eare bored will abide with him for ever.</p>
                  <p>Wait alſo upon the entruſting word, that yee may learne <hi>skill</hi> in the <hi>trade</hi> you take up and profeſſe, that ye may thrive in it. Reſolve to follow the counſell of the word, as <hi>David</hi> did,

<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.13.

                     <note place="margin">Ezck. 33.30, 31</note> and ſay to one another, <hi>Come I pray and let us heare what is the word that commeth forth from the Lord;</hi> but they are like <hi>Princes</hi> that have a <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> but they count that but a meere <hi>formalitie of estate;</hi> but they have a <hi>Cabinet councell,</hi> a <hi>cloſet councell</hi> beſides, a <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Privado's</hi> of men in all things under the ſame intereſts, and theſe only have their eare and their adviſe is obſerved. So it is with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites; and while it is ſo, that men have their <hi>whispering, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-ſtaire Councellours, Satan</hi> and the <hi>world,</hi> men will be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. But as <hi>Elihu</hi> excellently to <hi>Job,</hi> Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, That which I ſee not teach thou me, if I have done iniquity I will doe no more. Lord doe thou direct my errours, doe thou correct my miſcarriages, that which I miſſe and faile in doe thou give me light in, and ſet me right; I reſolve to follow thy adviſes, and if <hi>I</hi> have offended, yet it diſpleaſes me that I have done ſo, when thou reclaimeſt me I will doe ſo no more, and if I miſtake the way, when thou telleſt me of it, I will turne and take the other path. This is the mind of the ſincere, &amp; this will keep a man in the path of righteouſnes. A <hi>learned Divine</hi> reports it of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Thom. Thin,</hi> that he was ſo tender that he would undertake no buſines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was fully perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of it, both by <hi>cleare Texts of Scripture</hi> and the <hi>approbation</hi> of <hi>moſt learned,</hi> and <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Divines,</hi> he made ſcruple not only of committing the leaſt knowne ſinne, but of imbarking into any action which was <hi>questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> among thoſe that love the truth in ſincerity. This ſhew'd him to be ſincere, and made and kept him ſo, and preſerved him in the integriry of his wayes. O take heed that ye be anſwerable to your profeſſion and to the word that ye are hearers of; as ye carry a <hi>Bible</hi> in your hands, ſo let that be your <hi>Maſter,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Your <hi>ſoule-ſtate</hi> cannot be ſafe, if ye hearken to the <hi>foole</hi> and to <hi>rotten counſell</hi> that follow private <hi>Intereſts.</hi> Thoſe counſels will deſtroy a man,

Gods counſels are counſels of equity and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and enriching and eſtabliſhing counſels. Walke therefore after the word, credit it, eſteeme the wiſdome of it, honour the <hi>Soveraigntie</hi> and <hi>Royalty</hi> of it, ſet up no law againſt that law; maintaine not a cloſe counſell to contradict the reſults of this <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell;</hi> keepe in your boſomes the <hi>Aviſo's</hi> of this <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>wiſe boord;</hi> locke up the <hi>maximes</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> in your breaſts.

                     <hi>Remember the Law of Moſes,</hi> delight and meditate in it. It will adviſe you againſt the <hi>conſultations,</hi> and preſerve you from <hi>warping</hi> to the corruptions of the Malignant; as <hi>David</hi> found it in his experience;

                     <hi>Princes did ſit and ſpeake againſt me, but thy ſervant did meditate in thy Statutes.</hi> Let your <hi>ſecret meditation</hi> exceed your <hi>table-talk diſcourſes.</hi> You ſhall praiſe your counſell beſt by following his adviſe. Believe not the <hi>prating-ſollicitor</hi> who takes you off from the courſe preſcribed by your learned <hi>counſell,</hi> as if he had found out a more compendious and expedite accommodation; aſſure your ſelfe he will gull you, and leade you a great way about. The ſtraiteſt way is the neareſt way, I mean the equall and upright way; and all Gods wayes are <hi>equall.</hi> If <hi>Jacob</hi> had been content to have kept that way, and kept his honeſty, he had ſooner and more eaſily obtain'd the <hi>bleſſing,</hi> which he was like to have loſt, through too much haſte and greedineſſe to catch it. He hearkned to his <hi>mothers counſells,</hi> and it would have had a deſperate iſſue, but that God was carefull of him, and turned all to the beſt.</p>

                     <q>I will go thorough with what I have undertaken againſt you, and will ſtirr up men to ſeeke their freedome: Such as yeeld not to me at the firſt, I will overcome with the importunity of my wholeſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions.

                     <hi>Let us heare the concluſion of the whole matter, fear God, and keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> They are well joyned together, for that bleſſed man that feareth the Lord, will delight greatly in his Commandments, and will walke in his wayes; it is the beginning of wiſedom, that wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is in obedience; which the Pſalmiſt calls, A good wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or underſtanding;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 111.10.</note> 
                     <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſedom; a good underſtanding have all they that doe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>

Jeremiah</hi> was not diſmayed at the faces of the Princes,
<note place="margin">Ier. 1.17, 18.</note> Prieſts and people, becauſe Gods feare made him a defenced citie, and an iron pillar, and braſen walls againſt the whole land.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:155614:82"/>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> improves this <hi>argument</hi> upon his hearers,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> that they ſhould <hi>not feare him that can kill the body,</hi> (and that is all they can doe, and the worſt of their ſpight) but that they ſhould <hi>feare him that can cast body and ſoul into Hell fire.</hi> The <hi>Aſſe</hi> a dull and ſlow creature feares the <hi>ſpur</hi> or the <hi>whip,</hi> and will drive on roundly, but if it come to a <hi>fire,</hi> he feares that ſo much, that the ſpur may fetch blood, and the whip be ſpent and worne with laſhing, yet he will not be forced to goe forward. Here is feare conquering feare. You feare men, they frown and threaten, and beare a ſword; but offend not God to pleaſe them, for <hi>in his frown is death,</hi> his ſword is ſharper and his arrows ready.
<note place="margin">Eccluſ. 1.15, 16, 17, 18.</note> This is finely urged by an <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal</hi> authour; <q>They that feare the Lord will not diſobey his word, and they that love him will keep his wayes. They that feare the Lord will ſeek that which is well pleaſing unto him; and they that love him ſhall be filled with the Law. They that feare the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble their fouls in his ſight, ſaying, we will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men; for as his Majeſty is ſo is his mercy.</q> The force of this feare the <hi>receipt</hi> that I am now commending,
<note place="margin">Antonin. <hi>Ep. Florent. Hiſt. Til.</hi> 26 <hi>part.</hi> 2. c 4. §. 3.</note> I ſhall thinke fit to manifeſt in one experiment. The Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the third had a <hi>Chaplain,</hi> who one might entertained an <hi>Harlot</hi> into his bed, the <hi>Emperour</hi> by ſome meanes knew of it, but making as if he knew nothing, he commanded him the next morning to <hi>officiate</hi> in the <hi>holy ſervica.</hi> The <hi>Chaplain</hi> it ſeems having <hi>remorſe,</hi> and daring not ſo highly to profane the name of God, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf of his ſinne, <hi>refuſed</hi> to doe it. The <hi>Emperour</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him much; it was it ſeems to try him thoroughly. But he ſtill refuſing, the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſaid he ſhould either doe it or be baniſhed. He obeyes the ſentence and leaves the <hi>Court.</hi> The <hi>Emperour</hi> ſends after him, and his officers bring him back bound as a delinquent and ready to ſuffer, rather then to <hi>pollute</hi> the ſervice of God as he eſteemed. But the <hi>Emperour</hi> took him, and highly commending his <hi>honeſty,</hi> that he feared Gods wrath more then his, preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed a choice Biſhoprick upon him, and held him ever after very deare unto him.</p>
                  <p>This feare is in other phraſes called in the Scripture, <hi>The ſetting of God before one,</hi> or the <hi>walking with God.</hi> And that will make a man ſincere.

<note place="margin">Gen. 5.</note> We are ſure his wayes were ſincere, for the Scripture teſtifieth that they pleaſed God. This will cruſh the firſt riſings of <hi>hypocriticall thoughts;
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.5.</note> God ſees, ſhall I then dally, ſhall I mock God?</hi> We would not doe many things that we doe, if but a child ſaw us; and ſhall we not reſpect Gods eye? or doe we think God is blind? The Church in the Pſalme, obſerves this effect to her ſelfe of this medicine.

                  <p n="6">6. LAſtly, becauſe the main cauſe of hypocriſie is indulgence to corrupt affections, foure of which I took notice of, I am to propound ſomewhat for the cure of them.</p>

<note place="margin">The cure of Envy. Eccl. 4.4, 5. a Sam. 7.23.</note> 
                     <hi>Envy</hi> is the ſigne at which the foole dwels. <hi>Solomon</hi> is bold to give him that name: <hi>I conſidered</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour, The fool foldeth his arms together and eateth his own fleſh.</hi> Was not <hi>Ahitophel</hi> a fool to hang himſelfe,
<note place="margin">Eſth. 5.13.</note> becauſe another mans words were received with more applauſe? Was not <hi>Haman</hi> a foole, who could receive no comfort in his owne great preferments and places of honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe another man,
<note place="margin">Iob 5 3.</note> namely <hi>Mordecai</hi> was a Courtier? <hi>Solomon</hi> called ſuch men fooles, as well he might, and <hi>Eliphaz</hi> cals them <hi>ſilly ones, Wrath killeth the fooliſh man, and envy ſlayeth the ſilly one.</hi> 'Tis indeed a corrupt and rotten humour, <hi>The rottenneſſe of the bones,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 14.30.</note> and therefore by all meanes to be purged forth. But you muſt purge out pride firſt, for the proud foole is the envious one; <hi>He is proud,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.4. 1 Cor. 13 4.</note> knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof commeth Envy.</hi> After purging uſe ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theners, ſincere love, rejoyce in others good, communicate good with them.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:155614:87"/>to <hi>ſhine to others,</hi> and to let others <hi>ſhine.</hi> Rejoyce in others gifts. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo with the <hi>Philippians;
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.3, 4, 5.</note> I thank my God upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very remembrance of you, alwayes in every prayer of mine for you all, making requeſt with joy for your fellowſhip in the Gospell.</hi> And with the <hi>Coloſſians, We give thanks to God,
<note place="margin">Col. 1 3, 4.</note> ſince we heard of your faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and of the love which ye have to all the Saints.</hi> And if we cannot patterne this copy in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> unleſſe we have ſome to hold and direct our hand; let us conſider that God uſeth his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> in beſtowing of gifts, and wee muſt ſubmit unto his high pleaſure; but he is pleaſed withall to manifeſt his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the diſtribution, that we might ſtand in need of, and ſerve one another in love. I will not purſue this argument, it being whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly and fruitfully done already in ſome Tractates extant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Baniſh <hi>popularitie,</hi> and complying with opinion.
<note place="margin">The cure of Popularitie.</note> Entertaine not greedily the applauſe and affection of the <hi>multitude.</hi> It may prove to be <hi>poyſon</hi> to them who are yet very <hi>ſound.</hi> I know that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is accuſed to have been popular. 'Tis true, he <hi>preached</hi> with much <hi>freedom</hi> againſt the <hi>Court,</hi> which ordinarily is well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and thought of among the people: But to me it ſeems this <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular favour</hi> was beſide his indeavour, becauſe I find, where he might have made uſe of it, he declined it. For when a <hi>potent faction</hi> of errouious and ſome hypocriticall Biſhops had procured a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>baniſhment</hi> againſt him,
<note place="margin">Eraſm, <hi>in vita Chryſ. ante</hi> 1. <hi>To Oper.</hi>
                     </note> which was for nothing indeed but his <hi>honest zeale,</hi> yet durſt not execute the ſentence for feare of the <hi>people,</hi> to whom <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was very deare. But he to avoid <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,</hi> ſecretly came and delivered himſelf into the <hi>officers</hi> hands, and ſuffered his horſes to ſtand at <hi>one gate</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> that while the people flocked thither, expecting that there he ſhould <hi>take horſe,</hi> he went out privately at another. To me it appeares by this <hi>act,</hi> that he was and maintained himſelf <hi>ſincere,</hi> and that he fled from that popularity, which without his ſeeking, followed him. Know that your account is due to God, rather then to the world. Goe not in the croud. 'Tis good, yea ſometimes neceſſary to be <hi>ſingular.</hi> Choice plants grow but here and there, they grow not up like <hi>net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</hi> The beſt are ſo few, that in many places they are alone, like here and there a wheat ſtalk in a field of <hi>barly,</hi> ſo above all the reſt that they may be told and counted by one that ſtands afarre of.

<note place="margin">The cure of worldlineſſe. Mat. 16.24.</note> The moſt prevailing of all other inordinate affections is that of <hi>worldlineſſe</hi> or <hi>worldly-mindedneſſe.</hi> Againſt which that it may not make us <hi>warpe</hi> to any <hi>uneven</hi> and <hi>crookedcourſes,</hi> we muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially practiſe <hi>ſelf-deniall,</hi> without which we cannot be diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after Chriſt. To this end, endeavour to <hi>dry up,</hi> or <hi>divert</hi> the <hi>ſpring</hi> of <hi>ſelf-love;</hi> in the corrupter ſenſe and uſe of it I meane; for <hi>ſelf-love</hi> is a <hi>plant</hi> which Gods hand hath ſet in mans nature, and <hi>grace</hi> pulls not up what God planted, and <hi>nature</hi> as a <hi>freſh ſoyle</hi> yeildeth. We are to love our neighbours as our ſelves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſelves firſt as the meaſure of the other. But when <hi>ſelf-love</hi> keeps no meaſure, and comes to deſerve its name, becauſe <hi>ſelf</hi> only is <hi>loved</hi> and neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>neighbour;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14 7.</note> then 'tis turn'd to a <hi>weed</hi> which muſt be <hi>plucked up,</hi> for, <hi>None of us liveth to himſelf.</hi> But let us love our ſelves ſo, that inſtead of loving we doe not ruine our ſelves.

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.30.</note> the <hi>faſhion of it,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>paſſeth away.</hi> Let it not then ingage you too far.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe the world as though ye uſed

                     <hi>Baſil</hi> the great had this indifferencie to the world and all worldly comforts. His mind it ſeems was not ſet upon the world, for when <hi>Modeſtus</hi> the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour threatned him with confiſcation of his eſtate. <hi>Alas</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>doe you think that can trouble me who have nothing to loſe but a threadbare gown and a few books,</hi> and yet he was a moſt <hi>famous Biſhop.</hi> He cared not for the world, and therefore the world could not make him warp. For the ſtrengthning of this, I will only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend two things, and then make an end. 1. Get the <hi>love of Jeſus Christ</hi> into your hearts, which will be ſure to keep poſſeſſion and to command forth worldly love. It will ſtamp and imprint it ſelf, as they ſay <hi>Calais</hi> was in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> heart, which ſhe told them that were about her, they ſhould find <hi>engraven</hi> in <hi>legible letters,</hi> if they opened her heart when ſhe was dead.
